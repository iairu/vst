here is outdated barebone research (RESEARCH.md) and current existing physics (README.md) and features of my "AIV Vocal Chain" extension alongside control knobs described for each (README.md). I need you to work on new research that extends on physics formulas in README.md, knobs and their valid ranges, include important physics formulas for a great vocal chain, all existing features must be preserved, all existing content of README.md must be preserved in research, if something is incorrect show "incorrect formula:" and then "correct formula:"
